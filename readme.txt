1.-npm install --global http-server
2.-http-server
3.-Open http://127.0.0.1:8080

2.-Uncompress the heyzine-flipbook.zip file.
3.-Upload the flipbook folder, files folder, flipbook.pdf, and index.html to a folder in your web server.
4.-It should work straight away, but make sure the URLs from index.html are referring to the correct relative URLs of your website.
   You don't have to change any other file.
